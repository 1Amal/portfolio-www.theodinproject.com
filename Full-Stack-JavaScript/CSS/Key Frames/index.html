    <div>
      <p>
        The Caterpillar and <span>Alice</span> looked at each other for some
        time in silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its
        mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.
      </p>

      <div>
        <h1 id="watchme">Watch me move</h1>
        <p>
          This example shows how to use CSS animations to make <code>H1</code>
          elements move across the page.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, we output some text each time an animation event fires, so
          you can see them in action.
        </p>
        <ul id="output"></ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>
            Click anywhere on the screen or press any key to toggle the
            <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> between hidden and showing.
          </p>
          
          <div>
            This is a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element that animates between
            <code>display: none; opacity: 0</code> and
            <code>display: block; opacity: 1</code>. Neat, huh?
          </div>
          
          <p>
            This is another paragraph to show that <code>display: none;</code> is being
            applied and removed on the above <code>&lt;div&gt; </code>. If only its
            <code>opacity</code> was being changed, it would always take up the space in
            the DOM.
